# 🍽️ NutriTrack – Smart Food Recognition & Personalized Diet Planner

## 📌 Project Overview

**NutriTrack** is an AI-powered diet tracking system that leverages real-time food recognition and personalized nutrition planning. Unlike conventional diet trackers that rely on manual input or barcode scanning, NutriTrack uses **YOLOv8** for instant food detection from images, estimates nutritional values, and offers AI-driven meal recommendations tailored to user health profiles.

This solution improves accuracy, convenience, and engagement by automating the entire dietary logging process — from image capture to customized health insights.
